<strong>INTRODUCTION TO WIREFRAMING</strong>
</div>

**What is Wireframing?**
Wireframing is a crucial step in the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design process. It involves creating a simple, schematic visual guide—a blueprint—that represents the skeletal framework of a website, application, or other digital product.

<strong>IMPORTANCE OF WIREFRAMING</strong>
</div>

**Wireframing is important because it**:
**Provides an Early Visual Reference**: Allows stakeholders to conceptualize the product before development begins.
**Saves Time and Resources**: Identifying and fixing structural or usability issues at this early stage is significantly cheaper and easier than doing so during development.
**Facilitates Clear Communication**: Serves as a common language between designers, developers, product managers, and clients, ensuring everyone is aligned on the project's direction.
**Focuses on Usability**: By stripping away visual design, it forces a focus on user-centric design and functionality.
