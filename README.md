<strong>INTRODUCTION TO WIREFRAMING</strong>
</div>

**What is Wireframing?**
Wireframing is a crucial step in the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design process. It involves creating a simple, schematic visual guide—a blueprint—that represents the skeletal framework of a website, application, or other digital product.

<strong>IMPORTANCE OF WIREFRAMING</strong>
</div>

**Wireframing is important because it**:
**Provides an Early Visual Reference**: Allows stakeholders to conceptualize the product before development begins.
**Saves Time and Resources**: Identifying and fixing structural or usability issues at this early stage is significantly cheaper and easier than doing so during development.
**Facilitates Clear Communication**: Serves as a common language between designers, developers, product managers, and clients, ensuring everyone is aligned on the project's direction.
**Focuses on Usability**: By stripping away visual design, it forces a focus on user-centric design and functionality.

<strong>KEY ELEMENTS OF WIREFRAMING</strong>
</div>

**A well-constructed wireframe typically includes several key elements**:
**Layout Structure**: This is the arrangement of headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas. It defines the overall grid and spatial relationships between different components on a page.
**Example**: A wireframe might use simple boxes to show a three-column layout for a news website (e.g., main article column, related news sidebar, navigation sidebar), ensuring a balanced and logical content hierarchy.
**Navigation**: This element illustrates how users will move through the application. It includes menus, links, buttons, and breadcrumbs.
**Example**: A horizontal bar at the top of a wireframe with labels like "Home," "About," "Services," and "Contact" defines the primary navigation and establishes the site's main sections.
**Content Placement**: This involves determining the location of all content elements, including text blocks, images, videos, and headlines.
**Example**: A wireframe might use a large box at the top of the page for a hero image, followed by a smaller box for a headline, and several lines of Lorem Ipsum text to represent a body paragraph. This ensures content is prioritized correctly.
**Functionality**: Wireframes depict interactive elements and their behavior, such as form fields, dropdown menus, sliders, and modals.
**Example**: A simple rectangle with the text "Enter your email..." clearly indicates a text input field. A button next to it labeled "Subscribe" shows its function, clarifying the user action.

<strong>TYPES OF WIREFRAMES</strong>
</div>

**Low-Fidelity vs. High-Fidelity Wireframes**
Wireframes can be categorized by their level of detail and realism, primarily as low-fidelity and high-fidelity.

**Low-Fidelity Wireframes**
 These are basic, rough sketches often created with paper and pencil or simple digital tools. They use simple shapes, lines, and placeholder text. They are created very early in the design process to quickly brainstorm ideas, explore different layouts, and communicate core concepts without getting bogged down in details. They are ideal for rapid iteration and team collaboration sessions.

**High-Fidelity Wireframes**
 These are more detailed and polished digital representations. They may include actual content, more accurate spacing, and sometimes even simple interactivity.They are created after low-fidelity concepts have been approved. They are used to refine the layout, test specific user interactions, and provide a clearer guide for the visual design and development phases.

<strong> WIREFRAMING TOOLS</strong>
</div>
Figma and Miro

**Figma: A Recommended Tool**
Figma is a cloud-based design tool known for its robust collaboration features and versatility, making it an excellent choice for wireframing.

**Key Features for Wireframing**:
**Collaboration in Real-Time**: Multiple team members can work on the same wireframe simultaneously, leaving comments and feedback directly on the design.
**Components & Libraries**: Figma allows you to create reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, headers, navigation bars), which ensures consistency and speeds up the wireframing process.
**Prototyping**: You can easily create clickable prototypes from your wireframes to demonstrate user flows and functionality without writing any code.
**Cross-Platform**: Being browser-based, it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it accessible to everyone on the team.
